## Aspiring Data Analyst

### Project 1: Trade Analysis

For this first project, I used python and tools like pandas and numpy to clean, extract and analyze NBA data. As a life-long 76ers fan, I wanted to analyze and compare players who were on the trade market who can impact the 76ers in the right way. After analyzing the data, I went into Excel and created pivot tables and charts of each player. Thus, I would draw a conclusion from each player based not only on the eye test, but their averages each season in search for valuable trends.

### Project 2: Customer Sales (Tableau Dashboard)

This interactive dashboard built in tableau contains nearly one million rows of customer sales data. After importing the data into tableau, I was able to build charts, graphs, and maps to display my insights. These included revenue per state, gender, age, and much more. To make the dashboard intereactive, I added filters to each visual. This allows the user to narrow search results based on their individual needs.
