### Project 0: NBA East vs. West Analysis

I analyzed the NBAâ€™s Eastern and Western Conferences over the past 25 years to test my hypothesis that the West has been stronger overall. I used pivot tables and charts to visualize key metrics like win percentages, playoff appearances, and championship distribution. The data showed consistent dominance from Western teams across several categories, which helped validate my original hypothesis. This project let me blend statistical analysis with visual storytelling, turning raw numbers into clear, compelling insights.

### Project 1: Trade Analysis

For this project, I used python and tools like pandas and numpy to clean, extract and manipulate NBA data. As a life-long 76ers fan, I wanted to analyze and compare players who were on the trade market who can impact the 76ers in the right way. After analyzing the data, I went into Excel and created pivot tables and charts of each player. Thus, I would draw a conclusion from each player based not only on the eye test, but their averages each season in search for valuable trends.

### Project 2: Customer Sales (Tableau Dashboard)

This interactive dashboard built in tableau contains nearly one million rows of customer sales data. After importing the data into tableau, I was able to build charts, graphs, and maps to display my insights. These included revenue per state, gender, age, and much more. To make the dashboard interactive, I added filters to each visual. This allows the user to narrow search results based on their individual needs.

### Project 3: Coffee Sales (Excel Dashboard)

Similarly to project 2, this interactive dashboard displays coffee sales. With my data imported into Excel, I performed functions like XLOOKUP and INDEX to combine data from multiple spreadsheets to build this project. From there I created charts like 'Total sales', 'Sales by country', and more. The filters narrow search results based on the user needs and makes it convenient for the user.
